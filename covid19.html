				<ul>
					<li><p>Students are advised to keep a 'respectful distance' from eachother.</p></li>
				</ul>

			
			<h3>Face Coverings:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="https://www.mardenhigh.net/updated-guidance-face-coverings/">new rules</a> state that face coverings now only have to be worn in corridoors, where year bubbles can't be sperated.<br>This means that if students wish, they can take them off in their bubble zone (e.g- classrooms).</li>
					<li>You may take your mask off to eat inside.</li>
					<li>Face coverings must also be worn when queuing at food outlets.</li>
					<li>Face coverings must be worn over the mouth and nose when they are on, and not worn covering the chin.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Cross contamination:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Students must bring their own stationary and equipment.</li>
					<li>Students are not allowed to share their equipment with other students to reduce cross-contamination.</li>
					<li>Students must sanitise their hands when their enter and leave a classroom, at the start and end of breaks, and after going to the toilet. <br> They are encouraged to sanitse as traveling around school.</li>
					<li>When a student needs to go to the toilet, they must wash their hands for at least 20 seconds.</li>
					<li>Students are not allowed to gather with friends in the toilets and when going to their locker.</li>
					<li>There are new pedal bins around school, which can be operated with a foot.</li>
					<li>Students are not allowed to hug, high five, or shake hands.</li>
					<li>Students have set seating plans in their classes. This means that students must not move around in a class mid-way through a (half) term. This is to help with track and trace.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Cleaning:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Cleaning routines have been increased.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Further Changes:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Students must wear their PE kit on the days that they have PE.</li>
					<li>When students arrive at a lesson, they must go straight into the classroom:
					<br>There is no need to wait in the corridor, except for outside science labs and technology rooms, unless there is already a teacher in the classroom.</li>
					<li>Students must go home promptly, and not stay at the space in front of the gate.</li>
					<li>To increase air circulation, windows have to be open in classrooms. <br>This means that students have now been given the choice to wear a coat in the classroom if they are cold.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Detention Changes:</h3>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Detentions will be heald the day after a student had recieved the detention.</li>
					<li>Detentions will last for 15 minutes, from 3:15 to 3:30.</li>
					<li>Detentions will be held with the student's head of year.</li>
					<li>These detentions can be for any reason, incuding behavior, lateness, and homework.</li>
					<li>The member of staff who teaches the student period 5 will walk them to their head of year for their detention.</li>
					<li>The time spent will be restorative, discussing 1:1 how best to avoid similar sanctions in future.</li>

					detention the following day.</li>
