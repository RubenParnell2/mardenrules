  <h1> Marden High School Rules: Detentions </h1>

<br>
<br>

Due to CoViD-19, Detentions have been changed.
<ul>
<li>Detentions will be heald the day after a student had recieved the detention.</li>
<li>Detentions will last for 15 minutes, from 3:15 to 3:30.</li>
<li>Detentions will be heald with the student's head of year.</li>
<li>These detentions can be for any reason, incuding behavior, lateness, and homework.</li>
<li>The member of staff who teaches the student Period 5 will walk them to their Head of Year for their detention.</li>
<li>The time spent will be restorative, discussing 1:1 how best to avoid similar sanctions in future.</li>
<li>A text message will go out to parents / carers on the day the detention is set so they are aware of the
detention the following day.</li>
</ul>
