<br>
<ul>
<li>'Occationally, mobile devices may be used for a specific educational purpose, as directed by class teachers.'</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Online Saftey</b>
<br>
Students using social media should ensure that they are the correct age to be using the service.
<br>
Apps like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. have an age restriction of 13+. This means that students in year 7 should not use these apps.
<br>
<br>
These apps pose a risk for students to be cyber-bullied, so it is vital that students know the risks of using these apps.
<br>
<br>
<u>People should not:</u>
<ul>
<li>Be unkind or disrespectful to others (either directly to them or about them) - the same social rules apply online as in person.</li>
<li>Create large group chats without the consent of those that you are inviting.</li>
<li>Screenshot messages or social media content (videos, images) created by others to ridicule or be unkind about them.</li>
<li>Connect with people you don’t know.</li>
<li>Share other students’ details (phone number, social media profiles) with others.</li>
<li>Be complicit or silent about negative social media interactions that you witness - by doing this you are allowing these negative behaviours to continue.</li>
</ul>
